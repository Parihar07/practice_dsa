# Graphs

Graph algorithms covering traversal, shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and advanced topics.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Graph representations (adjacency list, matrix)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
- Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - Kruskal's, Prim's
- Cycle detection (directed & undirected)
- Topological sorting
- Bipartite graph checking
- Articulation points and bridges
- Connected components
