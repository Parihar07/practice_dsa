# Dynamic Programming

Problems focusing on optimization using memoization and tabulation techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Memoization (top-down DP)
- Tabulation (bottom-up DP)
- State definition and transitions
- Optimal substructure
- Overlapping subproblems
- Space optimization techniques
- Classic DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, LIS, etc.)

## Problems in this Directory
- `dp_fibonacci/` - Classic Fibonacci with DP
- `dp_nstairs/` - Climbing stairs problem
- `dp_perfectsquares/` - Minimum perfect squares sum
- `dp_maxpath_matrix/` - Maximum path sum in matrix
- `dp_max_sub_seq_sum/` - Maximum subsequence sum
- `dp_totalways_matrix/` - Count paths in matrix
- `dp_totalways_grid_obstacles/` - Paths with obstacles
- `dp_dance_party/` - Party optimization problem
- And more...

## Tips
- Identify the state and transitions first
- Start with recursive solution, then memoize
- Consider space optimization after solving
- Draw the DP table for better understanding
- Practice recognizing DP patterns
