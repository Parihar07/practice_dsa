# Dynamic Programming

Problems focusing on optimization using memoization and tabulation techniques.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Memoization (top-down DP)
- Tabulation (bottom-up DP)
- State definition and transitions
- Optimal substructure
- Overlapping subproblems
- Space optimization techniques
- Classic DP patterns (knapsack, LCS, LIS, etc.)

## Problems in this Directory
- [dp_fibonacci](dp_fibonacci/) - Classic Fibonacci with DP
- [dp_fibnacci](dp_fibnacci/) - Fibonacci (alternate spelling)
- [dp_fib_lambda](dp_fib_lambda/) - Fibonacci using lambda
- [dp_nstairs](dp_nstairs/) - Climbing stairs problem
- [dp_nstairs2](dp_nstairs2/) - Climbing stairs variant
- [dp_perfectsquares](dp_perfectsquares/) - Minimum perfect squares sum
- [dp_perfect_sqrs](dp_perfect_sqrs/) - Perfect squares (alternate)
- [dp_maxpath_matrix](dp_maxpath_matrix/) - Maximum path sum in matrix
- [dp_max_sub_seq_sum](dp_max_sub_seq_sum/) - Maximum subsequence sum
- [dp_totalways_matrix](dp_totalways_matrix/) - Count paths in matrix
- [dp_totalways_grid_obstacles](dp_totalways_grid_obstacles/) - Paths with obstacles
- [dp_dance_party](dp_dance_party/) - Party optimization problem

## Tips
- Identify the state and transitions first
- Start with recursive solution, then memoize
- Consider space optimization after solving
- Draw the DP table for better understanding
- Practice recognizing DP patterns
