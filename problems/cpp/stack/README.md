# Stack

Stack data structure problems and applications.

## Key Concepts Covered
- LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- Stack implementation (array and linked list)
- Monotonic stack technique
- Expression evaluation
- Parentheses matching
- Next/Previous greater/smaller element
- Histogram problems

## Problems in this Directory
- `stack_bal_paranths/` - Balanced parentheses checker
- `stack_char_troub/` - Character troubleshooting
- `stack_greaterleft/` - Next greater element to left
- `stack_smallerleft/` - Next smaller element to left
- `stack_largest_rect_histo/` - Largest rectangle in histogram
- And more...

## Tips
- Think of stack for "most recent" problems
- Use monotonic stack for next/previous element problems
- Stack is great for parsing and validation
- Can often optimize O(n²) nested loops to O(n)
