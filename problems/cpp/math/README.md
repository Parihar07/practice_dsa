# Math

Mathematical algorithms and number-based problems.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Prime numbers and sieves
- GCD and LCM
- Modular arithmetic
- Fast exponentiation
- Combinatorics
- Number theory basics
- Mathematical patterns
- Integer properties

## Tips
- Learn Euclidean algorithm for GCD
- Use modulo to prevent overflow
