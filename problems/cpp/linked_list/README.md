# Linked List

Singly and doubly linked list manipulation and algorithms.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Linked list design and implementation
- Two-pointer technique (fast/slow pointers)
- List reversal
- Cycle detection (Floyd's algorithm)
- Merging sorted lists
- Partitioning lists
- Deep copy with random pointers
- Doubly linked lists (DLL)

## Tips
- Always handle NULL pointers carefully
- Draw diagrams for pointer manipulation
- Use dummy nodes to simplify edge cases
- Practice reversing lists—it's fundamental
- Remember to update all pointers in DLL
