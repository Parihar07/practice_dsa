# Trees

Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal problems.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order)
- Binary Search Tree (BST) operations
- Tree construction from traversals
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
- Tree diameter and height
- Binary lifting
- Morris traversal (O(1) space)
- Tree views (left, right, vertical)
- Balanced trees
