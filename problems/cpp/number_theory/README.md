# Number Theory

Advanced number theory and mathematical problem solving.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Prime factorization
- Modular inverse
- Chinese remainder theorem
- Euler's totient function
- Fermat's little theorem
- GCD and LCM advanced applications
- Divisibility and factors
- Modular exponentiation

## Tips
- Master modular arithmetic—it appears everywhere
- (a * b) % m = ((a % m) * (b % m)) % m
- For modular inverse: use Fermat's theorem when m is prime
- Prime factorization in O(√n)
- Sieve modifications for advanced problems
