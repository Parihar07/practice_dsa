# practice_dsa

Collection of data structures and algorithms practice problems, primarily implemented in C++.

## Repository Layout

- `problems/cpp/<topic>/<problem>` – topic-first organization for C++ solutions.
	- Example: `problems/cpp/graphs/graph_bipartie/graph_bipartie/main.cpp`
- `restructure_plan.json` – machine-generated mapping from the original layout to the standardized structure (kept for reference).

### Topics

Current topic folders under `problems/cpp/` include:

- `arrays`
- `binary_search`
- `bit_manipulation`
- `dynamic_programming`
- `graphs`
- `hashing`
- `heaps`
- `linked_list`
- `math`
- `matrix`
- `misc`
- `multithreading`
- `number_theory`
- `oop`
- `queue`
- `recursion`
- `sorting`
- `stack`
- `trees`
- `trie`

Add new problems by dropping them into the appropriate topic folder. Use lowercase, underscore-separated directory names for consistency.
