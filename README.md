# practice_dsa

Collection of data structures and algorithms practice problems, primarily implemented in C++.

## Repository Layout

- `problems/cpp/<topic>/<problem>` – topic-first organization for C++ solutions.
  - Example: `problems/cpp/graphs/graph_bipartie/graph_bipartie/main.cpp`

## How to Use

1. Navigate to a topic folder (e.g., `problems/cpp/arrays/`)
2. Choose a problem subdirectory
3. Each problem contains a C++ solution file

Add new problems by dropping them into the appropriate topic folder. Use lowercase, underscore-separated directory names for consistency.
