 Problem Description
 Eight integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H represent two rectangles in a 2D plane.

 For the First rectangle,
 Bottom left corner is (A, B)
 Top right corner is (C, D)
 For the Second rectangle,
 Bottom left corner is (E, F)
 Top right corner is (G, H).
 Find and return whether the two rectangles overlap or not.


 Problem Constraints
 -104 <= A < C <= 104
 -104 <= B < D <= 104
 -104 <= E < G <= 104
 -104 <= F < H <= 104


 Input Format
 The eight arguments are integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.


 Output Format
 Return 1 if the two rectangles overlap else, return 0.


 Example Input
 Input 1:
 A = 0   B = 0
 C = 4   D = 4
 E = 2   F = 2
 G = 6   H = 6
 Input 2:
 A = 0   B = 0
 C = 1   D = 1
 E = 2   F = 2
 G = 3   H = 3


 Example Output
 Output 1:
 1
 Output 2:
 0


 Example Explanation
 Explanation 1:
 Rectangle with bottom left (2, 2) and top right (4, 4) is overlapping.
 Explanation 2:
 There is no Overlapping found.
